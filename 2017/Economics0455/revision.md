###Market Economy

####Advantages of Market Economy

1. Consumer **sovereignty**(主权) (1) **consumers determine** the goods and services produced (1) producers make what **consumers want** (1)
2. May be **more choice** (1) people can decide who to work for (1) may be choice of suppliers (1)
3. May be **efficient** (1) due to **competition** (1) drive **down costs** (1) **lower prices** (1) profit **incentive** (1) ability to earn **high wage**s (1)

####Disadvantages of Market Economy

1. May be **inequality** of income (1) the rich can increase their earning potential through saving/receiving a better education (1) some vulnerable groups, e.g. the sick may find it difficult to earn an income (1)
2. Private sector **monopolies** may develop (1) these may charge **high prices** (1) reduce **quality** (1) restrict **choice** (1)
3. Decisions will be based on **private** costs and benefits (1) existence of **external costs** and benefits (1) can cause **inefficient** choices (1)
4. Certain **beneficial** products (**merit goods**) (1) may be **under-consumed** and so **underproduced** (1)
5. Certain **harmful** products (**demerit goods**) (1) may be **over-consumed** (1) and so **overproduced** (1)
6. Some products (**public goods**) (1) may **not be produced** (1) difficult to stop non-buyers consuming the product (1)

###The usage of PED for Government
1. Knowledge of PED would help a government estimate how much tax revenue (1) it may earn from indirect taxes/changes in indirect taxes (1) may earn more on products with inelastic demand (1).
2. Knowledge of PED may help a government to estimate how much of a subsidy to give (1) a subsidy will have more of an impact on quantity (1) if demand is elastic (1).
3. Knowledge of PED will help a government estimate how successful it may be in reducing consumption of a product (1) example, e.g. cigarettes (1) more likely to be successful if demand is elastic (1).
4. Knowledge of PED may influence the price the government charges for the products it supplies (1) example of a product (1).

<span id="specialization" />

####Consequences of Specialization

#####Advantages of Specialising

1. Specialising allows countries to **concentrate on** what they are best at(1) influenced by factor endowment(1)
2. specialisation can **reduce the (average) costs** of production (1) **raise productivity** (1) efficiency (1) **enabling lower prices** to be charged (1)
3. Specialisation could **increase export** revenue/**improve trade position** (1)
4. Specialisation can **increase output/income/GDP** (1)
5. Specialisation can **improve the quality** of output(1)

#####Specialization reduce cost
- Workers can specialise in what they are best at(1) increasing productivity
- Workers cna be trained quickly(1) cost of training reduced(1)
- Less equipment is needed(1) cutting the amount of capital needed(1)
- Less time needs to be takne in moving between tasks(1) more time focused on production(1)

- A lower interest rate will cut the cost of borrowing(1) This may encourage households to take out loans and spend(1)
- Firms may spend more on capital goods/invest(1) as it will be cheaper to borrow(1) they may expect a rise in consumer expenditure
- Higher total demand(1) this may push the price level

####Cannot end deflation
- Households may be pessimisti(悲观) about the future and may expect prices to fall further in the future or that a recession will occur(1) and so may not spend more despite a lower interest rate(1) may choose pay the past debts.
- Firms may be pessimistic about the future and may expect prices to fall in the future.
- The interest rate may initially have been low(1) and so a cut may make little difference.
- Households and firms may expect the cut to last(1) and so will not alter their spending and investment plan.
- Banks may be reluctant(不情愿) to lend(1) may be lack of credit worthy borrowers(1)

- Fall in value would mean that more of the currency has to be sold to buy a given unit of another currency
- A fall in the value of the currency would reduce export prices(1) and increase import prices(1)
- Demand for export may increase (1) this may increase export revenue(1) if demand for export is price elastic
- A rise in export revenue or a fall in import expenditure will increase a trade in goods and services surplus
- Trade in goods and trade in services appear in the current account(1) credit items in the current account would increase(1) while debit items would fall(1)

##Unit-51 Change in Exchange Rate
##Unit-52 Free Trade and Protection

~~###Defects of free trade~~
~~**Increases competition** from other producers(1) if cannot complete due to **higher costs** may go out of business(1) may need **protection **to survive~~

###Dumping
<span id="dumping" />
- **The firms sell goods at a price, below cost of production**

###Advantages of Free Trade
1. Enables producers to specialise/expand (1) selling to a large market (1) can take advantage of economies of scale (1).
2. May be able to purchase raw materials more cheaply from foreign suppliers (1) lowering costs of production/increase efficiency/not having to pay tariffs on e.g. imported raw materials (1) buy better quality raw materials (1).
3. May be able to import new technology (1) ideas on new production methods (1) which could lower costs of production (1).

###Disadvantages of Free Trade
1. Increases competition from other producers (1) if cannot compete due to higher costs may go out of business (1) may need protection to survive (1).
2. If there is inflation in the countries they import from (1) will raise costs of production (1).
3. Will not be able to compete when there is dumping (1) will go out of business (1).

###Tariff
Effectiveness of tariff depends on whether the goods are commondities.


####Other country will implement protection policies

##Miscellaneous
##Whether price level of ??? will rise in the future

###Yes
- Demand is increasing(1) as incomes are rising/population are increasing
- Seller may rise price as demand is elastic(1) market power enable producers raise price
- Supply may fall(1) due to the (diseases)
- Producer is going to switch other products
- The worker in the production may become less productive

###No
- Producers may be merged(1) enabling greater advantages to taken of economies of scale(1)
- Concerns about the defects and harmful consequence of using/having the products(1) Demand will decrease
- If more producers enter the market(1) this will increae competitive and pressure and dirve down the price(1)

##Techniques on solving questions

###Springboard
Find something as an connection between the first key word and the second key word
* e.g. why a fall in the inflation rate may reduce a country’s unemployment rate
**Springboard=Total demand**

Why? **Labor <- Production <- Demand**
1. **demand** for the country’s products may increase(1),to **produce more**, a higher number of workers will be employed (2)

2. a lower inflation rate may enable a country to have a **lower interest rate** (1) this would
reduce the cost of borrowing/may encourage investment/encourage more **total
demand** (2)

3. a fall in the inflation rate may make the country’s products more internationally
competitive-more **international demand**(1) lower inflation rate may attract **more multinational companies** to set up in the country (2) this may **create new jobs** (3)

###Divison
Divide one key word into **several** parts, then discuss every part **specifically**.

* e.g whether a decrease in government spending will reduce inflation
