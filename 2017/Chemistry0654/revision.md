##List of Separation Techniques

1. Magnetic Attraction: **Separate magntic material**
 *e.g. cobalt from wood*
2. Filtration: **Get solid from a solid mixture**
 *e.g. sand from water*
3. Evaporation **Separate a disolved solid that does not decompose on heat**
 *e.g CuSO4*
4. Simple Distillation **Separate a pure liquid from a mixture of two liquid**
5. Fractional Distillation **Separate liquid with different boiling points**
6. Chromatography **Separate different color components**
